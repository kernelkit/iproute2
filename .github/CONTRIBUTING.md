## Contributing to Iproute2

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to Iproute2! Please be advised that the
Linux network community does not use github.com for their contributions.
Instead, we use a mailing list (netdev@vger.kernel.org) for code submissions,
code reviews, and bug reports.

Nevertheless, you can use [GitGitGadget](https://gitgitgadget.github.io/) to
conveniently send your Pull Requests commits to our mailing list.

Please read more about ["the development process"](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/network/iproute2/iproute2.git/plain/README.devel)
to learn how the Iproute2 project is managed, and how you can work with it.
